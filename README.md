<p align="center">Meet Sa11y, the <strong>accessibility quality assurance assistant.</strong> Sa11y is a customizable, framework-agnostic JavaScript plugin. Sa11y works as a simple in-page checker that visually highlights common accessibility and usability issues. Geared towards content authors, Sa11y straightforwardly identifies errors or warnings at the source with a simple tooltip on how to fix them. Sa11y is <strong>not</strong> a comprehensive code analysis tool; it exclusively highlights content issues.</p>
